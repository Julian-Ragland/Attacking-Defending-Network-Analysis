### Network Topology
_TODO: Fill out the information below._

The following machines were identified on the network:
- Name of VM 1
  - **Operating System**: Target 1 
  - **Purpose**: Web Server
  - **IP Address**:192.168.1.110
- Name of VM 2
  - **Operating System**: Target 2 
  - **Purpose**:Web Server
  - **IP Address**:192.168.1.115
- Etc.

### Description of Targets
_TODO: Answer the questions below._

The target of this attack was: `Target 1` 192.168.1.110

Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

 Excessive HTTP Errors

 HTTP Request Size Monitor 

 CPU Usage Monitor
 
 

### Monitoring the Targets

Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

#### Excessive HTTP Errors

Excessive HTTP Errors is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: When Http.Response.Status_code
  - **Threshold**: is above 400 for last 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Brute Force Attack Mitigation
  - **Reliability**: High Reliability

####  HTTP Request Size Monitor 
HTTP Request Size Monitor is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Bytes
  - **Threshold**: over 3500
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Http Document Requests
  - **Reliability**: Low Reliability 

#### CPU Usage Monitor
CPU Usage Monitor is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: CPU Usage
  - **Threshold**: 50%
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Excessive use by intruder to do tasks. *ie using john or my sql or wpscan

  - **Reliability**: High Reliability 

_TODO Note: Explain at least 3 alerts. Add more if time allows._

### Suggestions for Going Further (Optional)
_TODO_: 
- Each alert above pertains to a specific vulnerability/exploit. Recall that alerts only detect malicious behavior, but do not stop it. For each vulnerability/exploit identified by the alerts above, suggest a patch. E.g., implementing a blocklist is an effective tactic against brute-force attacks. It is not necessary to explain _how_ to implement each patch.

The logs and alerts generated during the assessment suggest that this network is susceptible to several active threats, identified by the alerts above. In addition to watching for occurrences of such threats, the network should be hardened against them. The Blue Team suggests that IT implement the fixes below to protect the network:
- Vulnerability 1
  - **Patch**: TODO: E.g., _install `special-security-package` with `apt-get`_
  - **Why It Works**: TODO: E.g., _`special-security-package` scans the system for viruses every day_
- Vulnerability 2
  - **Patch**: TODO: E.g., _install `special-security-package` with `apt-get`_
  - **Why It Works**: TODO: E.g., _`special-security-package` scans the system for viruses every day_
- Vulnerability 3
  - **Patch**: TODO: E.g., _install `special-security-package` with `apt-get`_
  - **Why It Works**: TODO: E.g., _`special-security-package` scans the system for viruses every day_
