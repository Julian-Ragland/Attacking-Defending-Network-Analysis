### Network Topology

The following machines were identified on the network:
- Name of VM 1
  - **Operating System**: Target 1 
  - **Purpose**: Web Server
  - **IP Address**:192.168.1.110
- Name of VM 2
  - **Operating System**: Target 2 
  - **Purpose**:Web Server
  - **IP Address**:192.168.1.115


### Description of Targets
The target of this attack was: `Target 1` 192.168.1.110

Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

 Excessive HTTP Errors

 HTTP Request Size Monitor 

 CPU Usage Monitor
 
 

### Monitoring the Targets

Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

#### Excessive HTTP Errors

Excessive HTTP Errors is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: When Http.Response.Status_code
  - **Threshold**: is above 400 for last 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Brute Force Attack Mitigation
  - **Reliability**: High Reliability

####  HTTP Request Size Monitor 
HTTP Request Size Monitor is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Bytes
  - **Threshold**: over 3500
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Http Document Requests
  - **Reliability**: Low Reliability 

#### CPU Usage Monitor
CPU Usage Monitor is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: CPU Usage
  - **Threshold**: 50%
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Excessive use by intruder to do tasks. *ie using john or my sql or wpscan
  - **Reliability**: High Reliability
